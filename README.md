# SuitsBBQ
A web app that uses the SUITS members JSON to take attendance of students at the weekly BBQs.

# Templating
All web pages have been ported to be rendered by the [pug](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pug) template engine. To render the templates in the `templates/` folder use `make render`. The script depends on a global installation of `pug-cli`. To install, run `npm install pug-cli -g`.

# Hosting
The webapp is hosted on [Firebase](https://suits-bbq.firebaseapp.com/)
